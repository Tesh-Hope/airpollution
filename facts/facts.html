<b class="facts-header"><h4>Air Pollution Facts</h4></b><br>
It is now an omnipresent fact that air pollution is extremely derogatory to health. Here is an interesting way that provides a fresh perspective into the harsh realities of how air pollution is the root cause of so many fatal cases around the world:- <hr><br>

Fact 1: Inhaling air pollution takes away at least 1-2 years of a typical human life.<hr><br>


Fact 2: It has effects as small as burning eyes and itchy throat to as large as breathing problems and death.<hr><br>

Fact 3: Pollutants that are released into the air, as opposed to land and water pollutants, are the most harmful.<hr><br>

Fact 4: Electric vehicles produce less air pollutants. They stir up dirt but without producing gases.<hr><br>

Fact 5: Producing heavy crude oil increases chances of air pollution by 40% than producing light crude oil.<hr><br>

Fact 6: According to the Lancet journal, air pollution caused by waiting in traffic increases the chances of death caused due to heart attack.<hr><br>

Fact 7: Toxic air pollution poses a greater threat to children, due to their smaller physical size and lung capacity.<hr><br>

Fact 8: Air pollution and resulting deaths are increasing fastest in Asia.<hr><br>

Fact 9: Air pollution that causes smog affects dolphins and makes them suffer from black lung diseases.<hr><br>

Fact 10: The best ways to reduce air pollution are by walking and riding bicycle.<hr><br>

Fact 11: A single bus caries passengers which are likely to drive 40 cars.<hr><br>

Fact 12: 65% of the deaths in Asia and 25% deaths in India are due to air pollution.<hr><br>

Fact 13: Air pollution in India is estimated to cause 527, 700 deaths every year.<hr><br>

Fact 14: It is estimated that 750,000 people die in China prematurely due to air pollution.<hr><br>

Fact 15: By 2050, 6 million people will die per year due to air pollution.<hr><br>

Fact 16: During heavy traffic jam, pollutants outside can seep into your car, making the air inside you car 10 times more polluted than typical city air.<hr><br>

Fact 17: According to the California Department of Education, Asthma is a leading cause of school absenteeism.<hr><br>

Fact 18: Indoor air pollution is 2-5 times worse than the air outdoors.<hr><br>

Fact 19: People who live near high traffic roads face greater risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma and bronchitis as these places contain more concentrated levels of air pollution.<hr><br>

Fact 20: Switching to more efficient and cleaner fuels from solid fuels(wood, biomass) can help you to reduce indoor air pollution.<hr><br>

Fact 21: The air pollution in Delhi is mainly caused due to industrial waste and vehicles. As of November 2018, almost 80,000 trucks ply on the roads of Delhi daily and most of them are very old trucks burning diesel and kerosene.<hr><br>

Fact 22: A busy road on Delhi can now be equated to Hitler’s gas chambers as the levels of VOCs, Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and ground level ozone are very high when one is on the roads of Delhi!<hr><br>

Fact 23: The pollution seems normal to us, as days go by. Our ability to perceive pollution to diminish day by day due to the human body’s tendency to numb out irritating smells.<hr><br>

Fact 24: Living in Delhi is said to be equal to smoking twenty plus cigarettes every single day.<hr><br>

Fact 25: Delhi Pollution claims the lives of more than 10,000 people every year. Winter season is especially bad in Delhi and shows an increase in pollution induced illness.<hr><br>

Fact 26: The pollutants in Delhi are evolving such that the human body can no longer filter out these harmful, carcinogenic pollutants. Called smart pollutants, pollutants like the PM 10 or PM 2.5 , contain particles that are less than 10 and 2.5 microns in size respectively. A human hair strand has a width of around 70 microns. Which means that these pollutants are too small for our bodies to filter out, granting them easy access to our lungs, causing severe respiratory problems.<hr><br>

Fact 27: Records show that the concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in Delhi are at 283 and 517 micrograms per cubic metre, which is way beyond the acceptable standards of 60 and 100 respectively.<hr><br>

Fact 28: Spring brings on clearer looking air, but is actually the time when sunlight reacts with nitrogen dioxide and VOCs to create ground level ozone, exposure to which is equivalent to rubbing sand paper on the insides of our lungs.<hr><br>

Fact 29: It's invisible. Apart from the obviously visible smog and haze in the Delhi air that most of us regard as indicators of air pollution, the most harmful toxins and gasses are completely invisible and hidden in what may seem like completely clean air.<hr><br>

Fact 30: The dreamy and romantic fog that we see is actually toxic smog. The haze that we see in Delhi during certain times of the year is often taken to be fog, such as that found in hill stations and resorts . This gives us a false sense of security . Most of it, however is smog, with high concentrations of Nanoparticles, which causes respiratory and other health problems.<hr><br>

Fact 31: We are more at risk in the safety of our homes. Indoor air pollution is five to ten times worse then outdoor air pollution. This is due to VOCs (volatile organic compounds) emitted from the materials used in our homes. A huge source of indoor pollution is our kitchen. Oil based particles which are suspended in the air due to cooking processes are extremely harmful for our lungs. A powerful exhaust system is imperative to protect us against this.<hr><br>

Fact 32: Filtering our drinking water could be futile in comparison. We drink two to four liters of water a day and spend a vast amount of time, energy and money on filtering it. In comparison, we are breathing twelve to sixteen thousand liters of toxic air daily and doing absolutely nothing about it.<hr><br>

Fact 33: To say that our respiratory problems are due to allergens in the air is a complete myth. It is the toxins in the air causing our problems,an anti-allergy pill will not help us.<hr><br>

Fact 34: Air pollution is the fourth-largest threat to human health, behind high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking.<hr><br>

Fact 35: Air pollution kills 800 people every hour or 13 every minute, accounting for more than three times the amount of people who die from malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS combined each year.<hr><br>

Fact 36: The five main sources of air pollution are indoor burning of fossil fuels, wood and other biomass to cook, heat and light homes; industry, including power generation such as coal-fired plants and diesel generators; transport, especially vehicles with diesel engines; agriculture, including livestock, which produces methane and ammonia, rice paddies, which produce methane, and the burning of agricultural waste; and open waste burning and organic waste in landfills.<hr><br>

Fact 37: Household air pollution causes about 3.8 million premature deaths each year, the vast majority of them in the developing world, and about 60% of those deaths are among women and children.<hr><br>

Fact 38: 93% of children worldwide live in areas where air pollution exceeds WHO guidelines, with 600,000 children under 15 dying from respiratory tract infections in 2016.<hr><br>

Fact 39: 97% of cities in low- and middle-income countries with more than 100,000 inhabitants do not meet the WHO minimum air quality levels, and in high-income countries, 29% of cities fall short of guidelines.<hr><br>

Fact 40: Keeping global warming "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F), as governments have pledged to do under the 2015 Paris Agreement, could save about a million lives a year by 2050 through reducing air pollution alone.<hr><br>
